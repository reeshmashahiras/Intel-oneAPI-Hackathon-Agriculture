# Intel-oneAPI-Hackathon-Agriculture
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Farmers face challenges in making informed decisions about crop selection and disease management. Traditional methods are time-consuming, subjective, and lead to suboptimal outcomes. Limited access to modern technology and expertise exacerbates these issues, leaving farmers vulnerable to economic losses and reduced productivity.

“Our solution aims to revolutionize this process by crop recommendation and the plant disease identification using Intel oneAPI toolkits”.
# SOLUTION
Our innovative web application, powered by machine learning algorithms and Intel toolkits, analyzes soil data to recommend crops based on nitrogen, phosphorus levels, and other factors. Additionally, integrated with Streamlit, it seamlessly incorporates image recognition technology. Users can upload images of diseased plants, enabling the system to accurately identify the specific plant disease.
# HOW IT WORKS
Data Collection:
     Soil data, including nitrogen, phosphorus levels, and other relevant factors, is collected from farms using manual input.
     Users can also upload images of diseased plants to the system for disease diagnosis.

Data Preprocessing:
The collected soil data is preprocessed to handle missing values, and normalize the features.
Images of diseased plants are preprocessed to enhance image quality.

Crop Recommendation:
When users provide manual input for nitrogen, phosphorus levels, and other pertinent factors, the system employs advanced data analytics to generate meticulously curated recommendations for optimal crop selection tailored to the specific agricultural context.

Disease Diagnosis:
Upon user plant image upload, the system employs advanced image recognition to accurately predict plant diseases, facilitating timely and informed disease management decisions.

# FEATURES:
1. A user-friendly interface accessible to farmers for inputting relevant data.
2. Personalized crop recommendations and disease predictions displayed based on the provided inputs.
3. Seamless integration with Intel oneAPI tools for efficient backend processing and real-time updates.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED:

# ADVANTAGES OF MIGRATING TO ONEAPI:
1. Availability of high computing services.
2. Good developer support.
