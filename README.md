# Intel-oneAPI-Hackathon-Agriculture
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Farmers face challenges in making informed decisions about crop selection and disease management. Traditional methods are time-consuming, subjective, and lead to suboptimal outcomes. Limited access to modern technology and expertise exacerbates these issues, leaving farmers vulnerable to economic losses and reduced productivity.

“Our solution aims to revolutionize this process by crop recommendation and the plant disease identification using Intel oneAPI toolkits”.
# SOLUTION
Our innovative web application, powered by machine learning algorithms and Intel toolkits, analyzes soil data to recommend crops based on nitrogen, phosphorus levels, and other factors. Additionally, integrated with Streamlit, it seamlessly incorporates image recognition technology. Users can upload images of diseased plants, enabling the system to accurately identify the specific plant disease.
